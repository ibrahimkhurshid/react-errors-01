1. Fix the odd way of using useState variable

2. Don't expose code directly to the component body, that changes the state. Put it inside some function which is called at appropriate locations.
(HINT: That will rerun during every render and will cause infinite renders)

3. Introduce use of useEffect, useCallback and useMemo hooks.
